In Python, you can use the print statement to display output:
print("Hello, World!")
This will print "Hello, World!" to the console.

Variables in Python are dynamically typed:
name = "John"
age = 25
salary = 50000.50

You can print variables using the print statement:
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Salary:", salary)

This will output:
Name: John
Age: 25
Salary: 50000.5

Python allows you to easily reassign values to variables:
age = 26
print("Updated Age:", age)

This will output:
Updated Age: 26

Remember, Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare the type of the variable explicitly. The interpreter infers the type based on the assigned value.
