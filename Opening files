In Python, file handling is an essential part of working with data and information stored on your computer. Python provides a built-in open() function to work with files. Here's a brief introduction to working with files in Python:

Opening a File
To open a file, you can use the open() function. It takes two parameters: the file name and the mode in which you want to open the file. The modes include:

'r': Read (default)
'w': Write
'a': Append
'b': Binary mode (e.g., 'rb' or 'wb')
'x': Exclusive creation, if the file does not exist
python
Copy code
# Opening a file in read mode
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
