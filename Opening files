In Python, file handling is an essential part of working with data and information stored on your computer.
Python provides a built-in `open()` function to work with files. Here's a brief introduction to working with files in Python:

### Opening a File
To open a file, you can use the `open()` function. It takes two parameters:
the file name and the mode in which you want to open the file.
The modes include:

- `'r'`: Read (default)
- `'w'`: Write
- `'a'`: Append
- `'b'`: Binary mode (e.g., `'rb'` or `'wb'`)
- `'x'`: Exclusive creation, if the file does not exist

# Opening a file in read mode
file = open('example.txt', 'r')

### Reading from a File
You can read the contents of a file using methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`.

```python
# Reading the entire file
content = file.read()
print(content)

# Reading one line at a time
line = file.readline()
print(line)

# Reading all lines into a list
lines = file.readlines()
print(lines)
```

### Writing to a File
To write to a file, open it in write (`'w'`) or append (`'a'`) mode.

```python
# Writing to a file
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, World!\n')
    file.write('This is a sample file.')
```
