In Python, lists and tuples are both used to store collections of items, but there are some key differences between them. Here are the main distinctions:

1. **Mutability:**
   - **Lists are mutable:** This means you can modify the elements of a list after it has been created. You can add, remove, or modify items in a list.
   - **Tuples are immutable:** Once a tuple is created, you cannot change the elements it contains. You cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple.

```python
# Example of a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 10  # Valid - modifying an element in a list

# Example of a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# The following line would raise an error because tuples are immutable
# my_tuple[0] = 10  # Invalid
```

2. **Syntax:**
   - **Lists are defined using square brackets `[ ]`:**
     ```python
     my_list = [1, 2, 3]
     ```
   - **Tuples are defined using parentheses `( )`:**
     ```python
     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
     ```

3. **Performance:**
   - **Tuples are generally faster than lists:** Because tuples are immutable, certain operations on tuples can be faster than equivalent operations on lists. This is especially noticeable for large collections of data.

4. **Use Case:**
   - **Lists are suitable for situations where the collection of items may need to be modified:** If you need a collection that can be changed, such as adding or removing elements, a list is more appropriate.
   - **Tuples are useful when the data should remain constant throughout the program:** If the collection is not meant to be changed, using a tuple can convey the intention of immutability and may also provide performance benefits.
