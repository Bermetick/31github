If Statements:
An if statement is a conditional statement that allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. It has the following syntax in Python:
if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true

Example:

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

In this example, the condition x > 5 is true, so the indented block of code below the if statement is executed, and "x is greater than 5" is printed.
