Control Flow:
Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. It allows you to make decisions and repeat actions based on certain conditions. 
The most common control flow structures are conditional statements (if, else, elif) and loops (for, while).

If Statements:
An if statement is a conditional statement that allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. It has the following syntax in Python:
If Statements:
An if statement is a conditional statement that allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. It has the following syntax in Python:
if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true

Example:
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

In this example, the condition x > 5 is true, so the indented block of code below the if statement is executed, and "x is greater than 5" is printed.

If-Else Statements:
An if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true
else:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is false

Example:
x = 3

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")

In this example, since x is not greater than 5, the code inside the else block is executed, and "x is not greater than 5" is printed.

Elif Statements:
An elif (else if) statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check. It comes after an if statement and before an optional else statement. 
If the preceding if statement is false, it checks the elif condition.
if condition1:
    # Code to be executed if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # Code to be executed if condition2 is true
else:
    # Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
