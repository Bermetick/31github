 In Python:

Data Types:

int: Represents integers (whole numbers).
float: Represents floating-point numbers (decimal numbers).
str: Represents strings (text).
bool: Represents boolean values (True or False).
Operators:

Arithmetic Operators:

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulo - remainder of division)
** (Exponentiation)
Comparison Operators:

== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
< (Less than)
> (Greater than)
<= (Less than or equal to)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
Type Conversion:

The bool() function in Python is used to convert a value to a boolean (True or False) representation. Here's an example:
# Example: Using bool() for type conversion
number = 42

# Convert number to boolean
boolean_value = bool(number)

print(f"Original number: {number}")
print(f"Boolean representation: {boolean_value}")

In this example, the bool() function is used to convert the numeric value 42 to its boolean representation. The result will be True for any non-zero number, and False for zero. When you run this code, it will output:
Original number: 42
Boolean representation: True

You can use bool() to convert other types as well. For example, an empty string "" would be converted to False, while a non-empty string would be converted to True.
Convert between data types using functions like int(), float(), str(), bool().
