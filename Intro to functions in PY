In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. 
Functions are a fundamental concept in programming and are used to organize code into modular and manageable units. 
They help improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

Here's a basic structure of a Python function:
 
def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    # Perform tasks using parameters
    # Optionally, return a value

# Example:
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Calling the function
greet("John")

In this example, greet is a function that takes a parameter name and prints a greeting. 
The function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses containing any parameters. The function body is indented below.

To use the function, you call it with the appropriate arguments. In this case, greet("John") would print "Hello, John!" to the console.
