In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. 
Functions are a fundamental concept in programming and are used to organize code into modular and manageable units. 
They help improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

Here's a basic structure of a Python function:
 
def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    # Perform tasks using parameters
    # Optionally, return a value
