Here are examples of both for and while loops in Python:

For Loop:
  
# Example 1: Iterating over a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Output:
# apple
# banana
# orange

# Example 2: Using the range function
for i in range(1, 5):
    print(i)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

While Loop:  
# Example 1: Simple while loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(f'Count: {count}')
    count += 1

# Output:
# Count: 0
# Count: 1
# Count: 2
