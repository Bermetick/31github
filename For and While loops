Loops are control structures in programming that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

For Loop:
A `for` loop is used when you know in advance how many times the loop should run. Its syntax typically includes an initialization, condition, and increment/decrement:

```python
for i in range(start, stop, step):
    # Code to be repeated
```

- `start`: Initial value of the counter variable.
- `stop`: Loop continues until the counter variable reaches this value.
- `step`: Increment or decrement applied to the counter variable on each iteration.

Example in Python:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```
This prints numbers 1 through 5.

 While Loop:
A `while` loop is used when you don't know in advance how many times the loop should run. It continues executing as long as a specified condition is `True`:

```python
while condition:
    # Code to be repeated
```

Example in Python:
```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
This prints numbers 1 through 5, similar to the previous example.

Remember to include a mechanism (like incrementing or decrementing a variable) to avoid infinite loops.

These loops are fundamental for controlling program flow and executing repetitive tasks efficiently.
