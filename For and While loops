Loops are control structures in programming that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

For Loop:
A `for` loop is used when you know in advance how many times the loop should run. Its syntax typically includes an initialization, condition, and increment/decrement:

```python
for i in range(start, stop, step):
    # Code to be repeated
```

- `start`: Initial value of the counter variable.
- `stop`: Loop continues until the counter variable reaches this value.
- `step`: Increment or decrement applied to the counter variable on each iteration.

Example in Python:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```
This prints numbers 1 through 5.
