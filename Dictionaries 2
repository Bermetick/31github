In Python, a dictionary is a mutable and unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Each key must be unique within the dictionary, and it is associated with a specific value.
Dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{}`, and each key-value pair is separated by a colon `:`. 
Here's a simple example:

my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}


You can access values by using their corresponding keys:

print(my_dict["name"])  # Output: John
print(my_dict["age"])   # Output: 25


You can also modify, add, or remove key-value pairs dynamically:

my_dict["age"] = 26      # Update value
my_dict["gender"] = "Male"  # Add new key-value pair
del my_dict["city"]      # Remove a key-value pair


Dictionaries are versatile and widely used for tasks where quick and
efficient data retrieval by a unique key is needed.
