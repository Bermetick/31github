### String Formatting:

String formatting allows you to embed variables and expressions inside strings for more dynamic content. 
There are multiple ways to format strings, and here are a few examples using Python:

1. **Using f-strings (Python 3.6 and above):**

  
   name = "John"
   age = 25
   print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
   # Output: My name is John and I am 25 years old.
   ```

2. **Using the `format` method:**

   
   name = "Alice"
   age = 30
   print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
   # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
   ```

3. **Older method using `%` (similar to C-style formatting):**

  
   name = "Bob"
   age = 22
   print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))
   # Output: My name is Bob and I am 22 years old.
   ```
