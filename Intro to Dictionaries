In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that stores a collection of key-value pairs. It is also sometimes referred to as an associative array or a hash map in other programming languages. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified after they are created.

Here's a brief overview of dictionaries in Python:

### Creating a Dictionary:

You can create a dictionary using curly braces `{}` and separating key-value pairs with colons `:`.

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3"}
```

### Accessing Values:

You can access the values in a dictionary using the keys:

```python
print(my_dict["key1"])  # Output: value1
```
